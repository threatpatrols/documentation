## Threat Management
Our Threat Management components (threat-perimeter, threat-discovery, threat-canary) enable our 
persistent cyber-security threat management products and services.

We are currently at that in-between time, where we want to tell people about what we have; 
working on the development; and having everything ship-shape in a way that works for customers.

Our Threat Management products are currently with a small number of existing customers as 
early-access development previews, and we really appreciate their interaction and regular 
feedback.  If you are interested in participating in our early product release cycles, then 
we'd love to hear from you too - https://www.threatpatrols.com/contact/development-preview

If you'd just like to be first-in-queue as our Threat Management products become more broadly 
available then please do get yourself signed up here for an occasional email 
from us - https://www.threatpatrols.com/contact/stay-in-touch

## Security.txt
We believe quick easy security contact is an important part of cyber-security operations.  We
like the [`security.txt`](https://securitytxt.org/) RFC9116 proposal and maintain 
a `.well-known` HTTP record and a `_security` DNS TXT record.
