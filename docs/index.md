## Threat Management
Our Threat Management components (threat-perimeter, threat-discovery, threat-canary) enable our 
persistent cyber-security threat management products and services.

We are currently at that in-between time, where we want to tell people about what we have; 
working on the development; and having everything ship-shape in a way that works for customers.

Our Threat Management products are with some hand-picked early-access development customers, 
and we genuinely appreciate their regular interaction and regular feedback.  If you believe you 
have the time resources available to participate in our early product release cycles then 
we'd love to hear from you too - https://www.threatpatrols.com/contact/development-preview

If you'd just like to be first-in-queue as our Threat Management products become more broadly 
available then consider getting yourself signed up for an occasional email from 
us - https://www.threatpatrols.com/contact/stay-in-touch

## Security.txt
We believe quick easy security contact is an important part of cyber-security operations.  We
like the [`security.txt`](https://securitytxt.org/) RFC9116 proposal and maintain 
a `.well-known` HTTP record.

 - HTTP: [https://www.threatpatrols.com/.well-known/security.txt](https://www.threatpatrols.com/.well-known/security.txt)

Additionally, maintain a `_security` DNS TXT record that points to the same HTTP record.

 - DNS TXT: `_security.threatpatrols.com`
