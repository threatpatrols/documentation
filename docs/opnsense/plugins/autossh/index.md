# AutoSSH (autossh) for OPNsense

AutoSSH for OPNsense is (currently) an older OPNsense plugin originally created by 
Nicholas de Jong and no longer works with current versions of OPNsense.

We are working on getting this plugin up-to-date, tested and published through the 
Threat Patrols repo packaging pipeline.
