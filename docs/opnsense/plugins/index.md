# OPNsense Plugins

## [Configuration Sync (configsync)](/opnsense/plugins/configsync)
Configuration Sync (configsync) is an OPNsense plugin designed to one-way 
synchronize the OPNsense system configuration `.xml` files to an (S3 
compatible) cloud-storage provider.  The `configsync` actions are triggered 
by OPNsense configuration save events.

## [AutoSSH](/opnsense/plugins/autossh)

The Autossh plugin for OPNsense is a tool for establishing, maintaining and 
managing reliable SSH tunnels with remote hosts. It can be used to solve a 
wide range of connection challenges through the (sometimes creative) use of 
TCP port-forwards.
